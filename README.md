# si507project2


###Minimal Flask Project
#### :open_mouth:What is in Lab 3:
You can find the class Movie in movies_tools.py. The class will allow a user to see movie title and its imdb rating in a form of a string. There is also code in movies_tools.py to get the number of movies in the movies_clean.csv.


#### :open_mouth:Relationship between movies_tools.py SI507_project2.py:
I tied the code I wrote for movies_tools.py into a flask application.

#### :open_mouth:Dependencies:
Flask needs to be imported. Code in the movies_tools.py needs to be imported. Both needs to be imported in SI507_project2.py. You can either pip install flask yourself or use the given requirements.txt file.

#### :open_mouth:What to do to run project properly:
After the flask setup, cd to where you downloaded the project files, and then enter "python SI507_project2.py runserver" Then, enter the given url which will look similarly to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ Once you're done investigating, go back to the command prompt and press ctrl+c to quit.

#### :open_mouth:Image file:
I drew the database diagram on paper, took a picture of it, and uploaded it to the directory.
